Welcome to my personal site! I am Vivek Das, currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kharagpur. With a deep passion for machine learning, distributed systems, and algorithmic problem-solving, I have cultivated a strong academic and professional foundation that I am excited to share here.

### Professional and Academic Background

I have a diverse range of skills and experiences that span multiple areas within computer science. Here are some of the highlights:

- **Competitive Programming:** Achieved a Specialist rank on Codeforces (handle: 'jaddu69') and a LeetCode rating of 1815, showcasing my problem-solving abilities in data structures and algorithms.
  
- **Research and Projects:** I have worked on several self-driven and academic projects, including a Wikipedia-Based Context Retrieval System for Science MCQs, Skin Lesion Classification using ensemble models, and a peer-to-peer chat application as part of my Computing Lab course. My current research involves a paper titled *PointCLM: A Contrastive Learning-based Framework for Multi-instance Point Cloud Registration*, under the guidance of Dr. Ayan Chaudhury.

- **Teaching and Mentorship:** As a Teaching Assistant for the Algorithm 1 course at IIT Kharagpur, I conducted tutorials, assisted with coding assignments, and graded work for over 165 students, helping them grasp complex concepts with ease.

### Skills and Tools

I am proficient in programming languages like C, C++, Python, Java, and SQL, and have hands-on experience with frameworks such as Scikit-learn and PyTorch. My toolset also includes libraries and tools like Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, FAISS, Git, NLTK, ReactJS, and BeautifulSoup4.
