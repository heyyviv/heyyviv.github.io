## üßÆ C. Gellyfish and Flaming Peony

**Time limit per test**: 2 seconds  
**Memory limit per test**: 512 megabytes  

Gellyfish hates math problems, but she has to finish her math homework:

Gellyfish is given an array of `n` positive integers `a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, ..., a‚Çô`.

She needs to do the following **two-step operation** until **all elements of `a` are equal**:

1. Select two indices `i`, `j` such that `1 ‚â§ i, j ‚â§ n` and `i ‚â† j`.
2. Replace `a[i]` with `gcd(a[i], a[j])`.

Gellyfish asks you: What is the **minimum number of operations** required to make all elements equal?

> **Note**: It can be proven that it's always possible to make all elements equal using the allowed operations.

---

### üì• Input

Each test contains multiple test cases.  

- The first line contains a single integer `t` ‚Äî the number of test cases (`1 ‚â§ t ‚â§ 5000`).  
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains an integer `n` (`1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 5000`) ‚Äî the size of the array.
  - The second line contains `n` integers `a‚ÇÅ, a‚ÇÇ, ..., a‚Çô` (`1 ‚â§ a·µ¢ ‚â§ 5000`).

It is guaranteed that the **sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5000**.

### üì§ Output

For each test case, output a single integer ‚Äî the **minimum number of operations** to make all elements equal.

## Solution

First we need to find gcd in the array. if any element is equal to gcd than we can simply pick a gcd element and non-gcd element and convert the non-gcd element to gcd element. answer will be number of non-gcd element in array. but problem arrise when there is no gcd element in array. In this case we need to create a gcd element in minimum operation.So wen need to find minimum steps to find gcd using smallest number of operation. We could do a bfs on gcd.

```C++
const int N = 5000 + 5;
int g[N][N];

inline void precompute_gcd() {
    for(int x = 0; x < N; x++) 
        g[x][0] = g[0][x] = g[x][x] = x;
    for(int x = 1; x < N; x++)
        for(int y = 1; y < x; y++)
            g[x][y] = g[y][x] = g[y][x % y];
}

```
Purpose: Quickly get gcd(x, y) for any x, y in [5000].
Why? To speed up repeated GCD calculations.
eucledian algorithm gcd(x,y)=gcd(y,x%y)

we need to find gcd of entire array.
Then we will gcd from every element in array. so that new gcd of array become 1. we can easily find steps to get gcd 1 in arrays.

If array contain gcd as one of the element we can easily get answer
```C++
if(has_gcd) {
    int cnt = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        cnt += (a[i] != 1);
    printf("%d\n", cnt);
    return;
}
```

If any element is already at the GCD, each other element can be reduced to GCD in one operation.
So, answer is the number of elements not yet at GCD

When No element is gcd
```C++
memset(f, 0x3f, sizeof(f));
for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    f[a[i]] = 0;

for(int x = m; x >= 1; x--)
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        int y = a[i];
        int gcd_xy = g[x][y];
        if(f[x] + 1 < f[gcd_xy])
            f[gcd_xy] = f[x] + 1;
    }

int ans = max(f[1] - 1, 0);
for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    if(a[i] > 1) ans++;
printf("%d\n", ans);
```
F[x] = minimum steps to reduce some number to x.
Initialize f[a[i]] = 0 (starting points). As we can get elements in array in 0 Operations.
All other f[x] are set to a large value (infinity).
For each possible value x, try to combine with each a[i] to get gcd(x, a[i]), and update the minimum steps.
The answer is the minimum steps to get to 1 (since after normalization, GCD is 1), adjusted for the number of elements.
Here m is maximum element in array. after Nomalizing entire array.
If we can reach x in f[x] steps, then we can reach gcd(x, y) in f[x] + 1 steps (one more operation).

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

const int N = 5000 + 5;
int g[N][N], f[N], a[N];

inline void precompute_gcd() {
    for(int x = 0; x < N; x++) 
        g[x][0] = g[0][x] = g[x][x] = x;
    for(int x = 1; x < N; x++)
        for(int y = 1; y < x; y++)
            g[x][y] = g[y][x] = g[y][x % y];
}

void solve() {
    int n, m = 0, k = 0;
    scanf("%d", &n);
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        k = g[k][a[i]]; // Compute overall GCD
    }
    
    bool has_gcd = false;
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if(a[i] == k) has_gcd = true;
        a[i] /= k; // Normalize
        m = max(m, a[i]);
    }
    
    if(has_gcd) {
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
            cnt += (a[i] != 1);
        printf("%d\n", cnt);
        return;
    }
    
    memset(f, 0x3f, sizeof(f));
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        f[a[i]] = 0;
    
    for(int x = m; x >= 1; x--)
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int y = a[i];
            int gcd_xy = g[x][y];
            if(f[x] + 1 < f[gcd_xy])
                f[gcd_xy] = f[x] + 1;
        }
    
    int ans = max(f[1] - 1, 0);
    for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        if(a[i] > 1) ans++;
    printf("%d\n", ans);
}

int main() {
    precompute_gcd();
    int T;
    scanf("%d", &T);
    while(T--) solve();
    return 0;
}
