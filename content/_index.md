# Welcome to Vivek's Field Notes

I'm Vivekâ€”a curious mind exploring the intersections of technology, creativity, and personal growth. This blog serves as my digital garden, where I share:

- **Technical explorations**: Insights into coding projects, development tips, and tech experiments.
- **Creative musings**: Reflections on design, art, and the creative process.
- **Personal notes**: Thoughts on life, learning, and the journey of self-improvement.
